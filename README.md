# AI-SaaS-User-Retention-Churn-Analysis
Building a data usig python and SaaS retention and churn analysis

This project analyzes user churn behavior in a simulated AI SaaS product using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

I generated a realistic dataset of 10,000+ users and simulated subscriptions, sessions, feature usage, and error logs Using Python.

Using MySQL, I cleaned and structured the data, built analytical views, and identified behavioral patterns linked to churn.

The Power BI dashboard highlights key drivers of churn such as plan type, engagement levels, feature adoption, and error exposure.

The goal was to understand why users leave and suggest data-driven retention strategies.
